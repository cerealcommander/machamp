# 🥊.©© What is Machamp.CC?

[Machamp.CC](https://www.machamp.cc) is the chronology of a very special Inclement Emerald Pokémon Run. In this run, we'll only be using the Machop line of Pokémon to beat the game. That’s right! Only Machops, Machokes or Machamps can be used the entire length of Inclement Emerald.

Let's jump into it:

### 📏 Ruleset
The ruleset is pretty simple, use the Machop line to conquer all of the battles available in Inclement Emerald Rom hack. Here’s a clear list of the ruleset as defined by me, @cerealcommander:

-	More Caps, Normal Mode and Randomize encounters
-	The Starter must be a Machop
-	Not Hardcore / No Perma Death
-	No Skipping Fights
-	Do double battles if possible
-	Bag usage is allowed
-	Only a Ditto or a Machop can be caught the entire game (Don’t catch a Machoke, it’s illegal)
-	Docs allowed
