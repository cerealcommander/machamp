# 🥊.©© What is Machamp.CC?

[Machamp.CC](https://www.machamp.cc) catalogs some very special Pokémon runs. This is a static site that catalogs the Pokémon games that have been completed using only the Machop line. That’s right! Only Machops, Machokes or Machamps can be used the entire length of any Pokémon game by me, **CerealCommander**.

Let's jump into it:

### 📏 Ruleset
The ruleset is pretty simple, use only the Machop line of Pokémon to conquer Pokémon runs. To help clarify what that really means, here’s a clear ruleset list defined by me, @cerealcommander:

- More Caps
- Normal Mode
- The Starter must be a Machop
- Randomized encounters (necessary to get our first 5 Machops)
- Can only use Machop, Machoke or Machamp for battles.
- Not Hardcore / No Perma Death
- No Skipping Fights
- Do double battles if possible
- All items can be used
- Bag usage is allowed during battles
- No moves are banned
- Only Dittos and Machops can be caught (So like, you can't catch a Machoke, it’s illegal 😁)
- Docs are allowed
- Save states are allowed (even in the middle of battle)
